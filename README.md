# ig.news

Ig.news is a blog, which has a subscription plan. Where the user who doesn't have a signing only can see a part of the whole post. The payment method is through Stripe. The database with all data about payments and users used is the FAUNA DB and the login system is by GitHub and Next Auth.

In this project, I learned a lot of new knowledge about authentication, payment methods, and NoSQL databases like Fauna.
